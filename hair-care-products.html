                                                    outside because they know that one tiny gust of wind is all it’ll take to turn their mane into a nest of frizz.

                                                    They contain rich ingredients such as natural oils and lipids, in heavier concentrations than normal conditioners.
                                                    You leave a hair mask in for an extended period of time, three minutes to overnight.</li>

                                                <p>You should apply your hair mask at least once a week as part of your normal washing and conditioning routine.
                                                    After squeezing the excess water out of your hair, apply the prepared mask to the lower two-thirds of your hair.
                                                    Massage the strands to ensure that there is optimal coverage of all of your damaged hair.
                                                    After the correct duration for your mask, you rinse your hair, then wash and condition it as usual.
                                                    This ensures that any build up released by the mask is washed away completely, leaving your hair as a fresh, clean, slate.
                                                    Towel dry with an old t-shirt or a specially made microfiber towel; the tough fibers of a traditional towel can roughen up the hair follicles, making your hair split.
                                                    Style as usual. You should see results immediately after your first mask use.</p>

                                                <li>Hair serum is a liquid-based treatment usually formulated using silicones that provide a protective layer over the hair fibre, assisting in smoothing frizz.
                                                    This smooth layer then reflects the light, which is how serum gives your hair a shiny, not greasy, finish.</li>
                                                <li>How to apply hair serum?</li>
                                                <img src="images/serum.jpg" width="200px" class="alignleft img-responsive" alt="">
                                                <p>Hair serum is normally applied onto wet or towel-dried hair after shampooing and conditioning, although some can also be applied onto dry hair, like the Absolut Repair Wheat Oil Hair Serum from Serie Expert.
                                                    Apply a few drops of the serum to your palm, then rub hands together and smooth down the hair from the roots to the tip.
                                                    Thicker or longer hair may require more drops.
                                                    A comb can be helpful to remove any tangles and ensure the serum is evenly distributed.
                                                    Because serum provides a protective coat over the hair, it can prevent damage when applied before using heated tools such as hair straighteners.
                                                    The protective smoothing serum from Steampod Care Products has Pro-Keratin technology and Steam-activated ingredients to give frizz-free high shine while also protecting against heat damage.</p>

                                                <p>Hair spray (also hair lacquer or spritz) is a common cosmetic hairstyling product that is sprayed onto hair to protect against humidity and wind.
                                                    Hair sprays typically consist of several components for the hair as well as a propellant.</p>

                                                <p>You only need a few drops of an essential oil.
                                                    You can mix one or more types in a shampoo or conditioner.
                                                    Or mix the drops into 2 ounces of a carrier oil.
                                                    Be aware that if you put some essential oils directly to your scalp, they may cause irritation.
                                                    Read label instructions for how to dilute oils, and never use more than the recommended amount.
                                                    If you're allergic to plants such as ragweed, test the oil on a small area of your skin or scalp to see if you have a reaction.
                                                    <ol>
                                                    Try these combos:
                                                        <li> Cedarwood, clary sage, and lavender.</li>
                                                        <li> Jojoba, clary sage, and cedarwood.</li>
                                                    </ol>
                                                    After you apply the oil mixture, cover your head in a towel or shower cap.
                                                    You can wash out the treatment after 30 minutes, leave it on overnight and shampoo in the morning, or use some as a leave-in conditioner. See what works best for your hair texture.
