                                <p class="lead">Why is the hair fading?<br>
                                    If you look at the pictures of President Obama taken before he ran for president and
                                    since he left office, you will notice a clear difference: previously only brown hair dark,
                                    he now has more silver than brown. It seems the tension of running a country will make
                                    anyone gray-haired. But does stress really cause gray hair? And why does the hair turn gray,
                                    even for those who work under stress like the President of the United States? <br>
                                </p>
                                <p>In humans, most gray hair is not related to stress. In fact, hair doesn't actually "turn to" gray hair.
                                    When the hair follicle forms the hair, the hair color is predefined.
                                    If a strand of hair starts to turn brown (either red or black or yellow), it will
                                    never change color (unless you dye it). Hair follicles produce less color as they age,
                                    so as hair goes through a natural death cycle and is regenerated, hair is more likely to
                                    develop into gray hair that begins after age 35. Genetics can close. a role in gray hair inception.
                                    Although stress cannot make your hair gray, stress can cause a common condition called telogen
                                    effluvium (telogen effluvium) hair loss, which causes hair to fall out about three times faster than normal.
                                    However, hair will grow back, so this condition does not cause baldness.
                                    But if you are middle-aged, your hair falls out a lot and regenerates more quickly due to stress,
                                    then it is possible that your hair grows silver instead of its original color.
                                    A 2020 study in rats demonstrated that stress can result in their feathers turning silver under stress.
                                    Whether this applies to humans and how stress plays a role in graying is not yet clear.
                                    Stress A 2020 study in rats has demonstrated that stress can lead to their feathers
                                    turning gray under stress. Diseases that cause gray hair Most people with gray hair are
                                    due to old age. However, sometimes gray hair shows up as a sign of the disease, especially
                                    if it occurs at a particularly young age. Health problems that can be foretold by gray hair
                                    include: Vitamin B12 deficiency Nneurofibromatosis (also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease):

                                    that causes benign tumors in many organs (including brain, heart, kidneys, eyes, lungs, and skin).
                                    Vitiligo: This condition causes melanocytes (the cells at the base of the hair follicles
                                    that give off color) to be lost or destroyed, possibly due to the immune system attacking the scalp.
                                    Alopecia areata: this is a disorder in which patches of hair can fall off suddenly, especially colored
                                    strands (not gray hair). This can lead to gray hair "overnight" because gray or white hairs suddenly

                                            <li>Stage Anagen: Anagen is the active growth phase of the hair follicles,
                                                during which the base of the hair divides rapidly, contributing to the
                                                growth of the hair's length. During this stage, hair grows about 1 cm every 28 days.
                                                Meanwhile, hair maintains this period of active growth for 2–7 years;
                                                This stage is genetically determined. At the end of the anagen phase,
                                                an unknown signal causes the follicle to enter the catagen phase.

                                            <li>Stage Catagen: The catagen phase is a short transition period that occurs
                                                towards the end of the anagen phase. It signals the end of active hair growth.
                                                This phase lasts about 2-3 weeks. The hair cells near the hair follicles
                                                have their blood supply cut off and stopped growing.

                                            <li>Stage Telogen: The telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle.
                                                When the body is under stress, about 70% of the hair can transition early
                                                into the telogen phase and noticeable loss of hair begins.
                                                The hair cells in the telogen phase are dead cells and are keratinized
                                                to resemble the surface epidermis of the skin. There are about 50 to 100
